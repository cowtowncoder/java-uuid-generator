Here are people who have contributed to JUG development:

Tatu Saloranta, tatu.saloranta@iki.fi: Author

Leonid Kunin: suggested adding 2 constructors (that were missing);
	needed when storing binary representations of UUIDs
	(added to v0.9.2)
    [0.9.2]

Paul Blankenbaker: provided the native code for accessing Ethernet
	MAC-addresses (on linux/x86, Solaris/sparc, Windows); first
	included in 1.0.0 release.
    [1.0.0]

Gernot Koller: pointed out a bug in UUID.toByteArray() method; was
	not using offset (fixed in 1.0.1)
    [1.0.1]

Dominique Jean-Prost: Suggested that there should be alternate method
    	of loading native libs (implemented in 1.0.2).
	Also pointed out that method 'setLibDir' should be public, not
     	protected (fixed in 1.0.2).
    [1.0.2]

Jeff Woodward: Pointed and fixed a bug in UUID.toByteArray() method
   (not sure if Gernot's fix was somehow overwritten in codebase
   or what...).
  [1.0.3]

D.J Hagberg: Submitted native code to use with Mac OS X, to use for
   accessing MAC address of primary network interface (code should
   also work with *BSDs?).
   Also contributed improvements to Ant's build.xml.
   [1.0.3]

G�ran L�wkrantz: Submitted native code for FreeBSD/x86
  [1.1]

Eric Bie: Wrote full unit test suite, using JUnit! Really REALLY
   useful addition (old ad hoc tests needed replacement).
   Also cleaned up ant build file significantly.
  [1.1]

Bill Sarra: Pointed out and fix Windows native code bug that would
   under some circumstances cause infinite looping when trying to
   access MAC addresses of all interfaces.
  [1.1]

Ralf S. Engelschall: Pointed out and fixed a bug in generating
  dummy broadcast ethernet addresses; interpretation of LSB/MSB
  was incorrect with respect to ethernet broadcast & structs.
  [1.1] 
 
Wolfgang Hoschek: Suggested useful improvement to random UUIDs;
  there's no requirement for API to enforce use of SecureRandom.
  Thus, code now only expects Random, although still creates
  SecureRandom if no explicit generator is passed. This can help
  in reducing startup time of generator, as well as max. rate
  of UUID generation, depending on how quickly Random instance
  can be initialized & generates new numbers.

Jonas F�gedi: Contributed the patch to check for FreeBSD platform
  (which actually was part of an earlier patch that I somehow had
   managed not to get in... :-/ )
  [1.1.1]

David Pawson: Pointed out that the jar file was missing the necessary
  Main-Class definition, which prevented it from being invoked from
  command line using -jar switch.
  [1.1.2]

Pekka Enberg: Pointed out a bug in Linux JNI code; the socket was not
  properly closed
  [2.0.0]

Thomas Wernitz: Pointed out a problem with MacOS JNI code; wasn't
  properly looping through the interfaces
  [2.0.0]

Asher Glynn: Suggested usefulness of external file-based synchronization,
  to ensure that system clock moving backwards during reboot does not
  compromise uniqueness of produced UUIDs (which is obviously also mentioned
  in UUID specs, but previously not implemented in Jug).
  [2.0.0]

Wim Deblauwe: Pointed out problems with 2.0rc3 jars (missing
  com.ccg.net.ethernet package, no downloadable JNI code).
  [2.0rc3]

Klaus Rheinwald: Contributed non-netbios Windows JNI code for accessing
  Ethernet addresses
  [2.0rc5]

Fran�ois Berenger:
  Pointed out a method signature problem that prevent unit test compilation
  [2.1]

Tarusawa Hiroyuki:
  Reported missing Maven(2) jars for JUG.

Ed Anuff:
  Reported Issue #7: Bytes of clock sequence were switched (unlikely to cause
  problems, but incorrect -- regression from 2.x)
  [3.1.3]

Felix W. Dekker (FWDekker@github)
  Contributed #36: Add customisable clock to UUIDTimer
  [3.3.0]

Andre Brait (andrebrait@github)
  Contributed #32: Use SLF4J instead of Log4J directly
  [4.0]

Pascal Schumacher (PascalSchumacher@github)
  * Reported #37: Problematic OSGI version range for slf4j dependency
  [4.0.1]

Hal Hildebrand (Hellblazer@github)
  * Contributed #41: Add support for Proposed type v6 (reordered timestamp)
  [4.1.0]
  * Contributed #46: Add support for Proposed type v7 (epoch-based time uuid)
  [4.1.0]
  * Contributed fix fox #69: UUID version 7 implementation sorting incorrect?
  [4.1.1]

Dirk-Jan Rutten (excitement-engineer@github)
  * Reported #69: UUID version 7 implementation sorting incorrect?
  [4.1.1]
